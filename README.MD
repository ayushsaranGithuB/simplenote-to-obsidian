This is a demo of a simplenote to obsidian converter

#HOW IT WORKS

1. Upload the JSON file from simplenote that contains an export of all your notes

2. Parse the notes and convert Tags into Obsidian compatible #Tags

3. Export each note into its own .md file

4. Create a Zip for export that can be downloaded by the user to import into Obsidian
