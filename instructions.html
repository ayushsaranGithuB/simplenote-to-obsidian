                This tool allows you to convert your Simplenote notes to Obsidian format.
            </p>

            <p>
                To use this tool, you need to export your Simplenote notes as a JSON file. You can do this by going to
                Simplenote, clicking on the three dots in the top right corner, and selecting "Export Notes". This will
                download a JSON file containing all your notes.
            </p>

            <p>
                <small>The notes.json is found under ./source/ from the simplenote export ZIP</small>
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you have the JSON file, you can upload it here by dragging and dropping it into the upload field or
                selecting the file from your computer.
            </p>

            <p>
                The tool will convert your Simplenote notes [.txt] to Obsidian format [.MD] and preserve the tags
                associated
                with each note.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the conversion is complete, you will receive a ZIP file containing all your notes in Obsidian
                format. Download and Unzip to get a folder with all your notes.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can then import this folder into Obsidian by Draging and dropping the folder
                into the File explorer window
                <br><br>
                OR
                <br><br>
                Use your system file browser (e.g. Windows Explorer or Finder on macOS), and move your files directly
                into the Obsidian vault folder.
            </p>
